## Rendering Mandelbrot set in the browser using GLSL

Noteworthy: fragment and vertex shaders have distinct files and are not part of any html inline script.

### Requirements

    node
    bower
    
### Install

    npm install
    bower install
    
### Run

I use live-server to show it in the browser. You can install live-server using `npm install -g live-server`. 
After that you can start this example like so: 

    live-server

(it uses port 8080 by default)
